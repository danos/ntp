Description: Network Time Protocol: network utilities
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains control programs which can access a remote NTP
 server.  Thus you will need either ntp-simple or ntp-refclock;
 ntp-refclock includes drivers for radio clocks.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol / NTP server configuration
 and operation, load the optional Debian package 'ntp-doc'.

Description: Network Time Protocol: common server tools
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package holds the common files for the NTP server and all programs
 which need to run on the actual server.
 .
 There are two server packages: 'ntp-simple' only knows about your computer's
 built-in clock. 'ntp-refclock' has built-in support for a variety of
 time signal receivers. Both server packages, of course, can synchronize
 with other servers across the Internet.

Description: Network Time Protocol: daemon for simple systems
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This version of the ntp daemon can synchronize to other servers across
 the Internet, or (if none are available) use your computer's built-in
 clock as a time source for a local network. It is sufficient for most
 systems.
 .
 If you wish to configure a reference clock, particularly if you have a radio 
 clock, use the ntp-refclock package instead.

Description: Network Time Protocol: daemon for reference clocks
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This version of the ntp daemon can understand a variety of time signal
 receivers. If you do not have a radio clock, use the ntp-simple package
 instead, as it consumes far less memory.
 .
 If you're serious about building a high-quality stratum 1 timekeeper, please
 take a look at Ulrich Windl's PPSkit patchset for the Linux kernel, available
 from the kernel.org mirror network in pub/linux/daemons/ntp.

Description: The ntpdate client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client which allows a system's clock to be set
 to match the time obtained by communicating with one or more servers.
 .
 ntpdate is optional (but recommended) if you're running an NTP server,
 because initially setting the system clock to an almost-correct time
 will help the NTP server synchronize faster.
 .
 The ntpdate client by itself is useful for occasionally setting the time on
 machines that are not on the net full-time, such as laptops.

Description: Network Time Protocol: documentation
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation for the ntp packages (ntp,
 ntpdate, ntp-simple, ntp-refclock).  Since there are no substantive man
 pages for ntp's programs and configuration files, this package is
 desirable for any setup beyond the simple configuration supplied by the
 server packages.

Description: Network Time Protocol: debug symbols for ntp-simple
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the ntp-simple server.
 You need this package if you want to debug NTP problems with gdb
 or other symbolic debuggers.

Package: ntp-refclock-dbg

Description: Network Time Protocol: debug symbols for ntp-refclock
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the ntp-refclock server.
 You need this package if you want to debug NTP problems with gdb
 or other symbolic debuggers.

Description: Network Time Protocol: debug symbols for non-servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for all ntp utilities,
 excluding the server. You need this package if you want to debug
 NTP problems with gdb or other symbolic debuggers.
