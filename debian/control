Description: Network Time Protocol: server and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the server and utility programs.
 .
 If you're serious about building a high-quality stratum 1 timekeeper, please
 take a look at Ulrich Windl's PPSkit patchset for the Linux kernel, available
 from the kernel.org mirror network in pub/linux/daemons/ntp.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol / NTP server configuration
 and operation, load the optional Debian package 'ntp-doc'.

Description: The ntpdate client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client which allows a system's clock to be set
 to match the time obtained by communicating with one or more servers.
 .
 ntpdate is optional (but recommended) if you're running an NTP server,
 because initially setting the system clock to an almost-correct time
 will help the NTP server synchronize faster.
 .
 The ntpdate client by itself is useful for occasionally setting the time on
 machines that are not on the net full-time, such as laptops.

Description: Network Time Protocol: documentation
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate
 over the Internet, or by following an accurate hardware receiver which
 interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation for the ntp packages (ntp, ntpdate).  
 Since there are no substantive man pages for ntp's programs and
 configuration files, this package is desirable for any setup beyond the
 simple configuration supplied by the server packages.
